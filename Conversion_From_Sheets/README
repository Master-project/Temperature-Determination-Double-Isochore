The piece of code to be run to run the program is 'Conversion.py'

This code is to be run using Python 3 (https://www.python.org/)s

To run this code one must make sure that numpy, pandas, matplotlib are installed along with all of the standard Python3 packages.

This code is relatively self explanatory, the way in which it is structured means that the two files located in this folder need
to be located in the same folder at the time of running the code. 

The code pops up a window for a selection of material, then once this is selected allows the user to select whether or not to plot 
graphs. This is then followed by the selection of either pressures or temperatures which can output tables or graphs at the user's
request. Volumes need to be input in angstroms^3 per unit cell.

Note that all code used in the calculation of the properties mentioned is taken from the VBA code provided by Sokolova et al. in 
their 2016 paper "Microsoft Excel spreadsheets for calculation of P-V-T relations and thermodynamic
properties from equations of state of MgO, diamond and nine metals as pressure
markers in high-pressure and high-temperature experiments".
