The piece of code to be run to run the program is 'Sokolova_Isochore_Solver.py'

This code is to be run using Python 3 (https://www.python.org/)s

To run this code one must make sure that numpy, pandas, matplotlib are installed along with all of the standard Python3 packages.

This code is used to determine the temperature of two materials using the volume of both materials.

This code is relatively self explanatory, the way in which it is structured means that the two files located in this folder need
to be located in the same folder at the time of running the code. 

The code pops up a window for a selection of two materials or for custom parameters, one can also incorporate errors into the analysis.

Note that the volumes and their errors need to be supplied in Angstroms^3 per atom.

The user can also select whether or not they want to incorporate graphical analysis with the plotting and saving of graphs
This is implemented by the simple use of checkboxes.

The algorithm for determining the temperature is detailed extensively in the Report along with detailed comments given in the code

Note that all code used in the calculation of the properties mentioned is taken from the VBA code provided by Sokolova et al. in 
their 2016 paper "Microsoft Excel spreadsheets for calculation of P-V-T relations and thermodynamic
properties from equations of state of MgO, diamond and nine metals as pressure
markers in high-pressure and high-temperature experiments".
