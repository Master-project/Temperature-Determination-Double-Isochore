The piece of code to be run to run the program is 'Isochore_Temperature_Determination.py'

This code is to be run using Python 3 (https://www.python.org/)

To run this code one must make sure that numpy, pandas, matplotlib are installed along with all of the standard Python3 packages.

This code is used to determine the temperature of two materials using the volume of both materials.

This code is relatively self explanatory, the way in which it is structured means that the two files located in this folder need
to be located in the same folder at the time of running the code.

Notes for isothermal EOSs
##########################

Due to the nature of the Holzapfel APL equation of state, it is very particular on how parameters are entered.
As a result of this, all volumes (both compressed and v_0) specified when using this equation of state have to be in
the same form as was originally shown in the spreadsheets provided by Sokolova (10.1016/j.cageo.2016.06.002) i.e. 
V Jbar^-1. The other parameters should also be in the same form as was given in the paper, with Bo being in kbar.
This will give a result of pressure in bars.

The other two isothermal equations of state which are implemented do not have such stringent conditions imposed on t
their parameters and will allow for any parameter set with consistent units.

Note for isothermal EOSs
############################

The Mie-Gruneisen-Debye implement ation of a thermal Equation of state has similar problems to that of the Holzapfel APL equation of state in that the volume needs to be in a specific form (noted thanks to the help section in Ross Angels EOSfit http://www.rossangel.com/home.htm)

The implementation given in this code requires the bulk modulus to be in GPa and the volumes (V and V_0) to be in Angstroms^3/cell.

The other thermal equations of state do not have such constraints and will give correct values for pressure with any parameter set which has consistent units.


############################################################
Incorporation of error is also given in this program using a method given in Practical Physics by Squires.

The user can also select whether or not they want to incorporate graphical analysis with the plotting and saving of graphs
This is implemented by the simple use of checkboxes.

The algorithm for determining the temperature is detailed extensively in the Report along with detailed comments given in the code
